AI(Artificial Intelligence) : 
The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by 
humans.
AI can be both simple and complex.

ML(Machine Learning) :
ML figures out the rules for us by taking data and output or
ML takes data and output as input and figures out process of how
this output is generated from using that data as input for that
output.
Goal of ML is to raise accuracy of calculating correct data as 
much as possible.
In ML , rather than giving the program the rules, an algorithm 
finds the rules for us.

NN(Neural Network) : 
NN is a form machine learning that uses a layered representation
of data.
It is also called Multi-stage information extraction process.
NN i totally named after human brain because we not much know about
how human brain works.

Features : Feautres are the input information that we will always 
have that we need to give to the model to get some output.
